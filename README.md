# Hi, I’m Aka 👋
I’m a software engineer who loves building real-world systems.

## 🚧 My Projects
- [Custom POS System](#): Used in my own coffee shop.
- [Tamakit UI Kit](#): A React/Tamagui component kit.
- [Community Platform](#): Helps students and developers connect.

## 📚 My Story
After years in startups adding features to existing systems, I built my own business from zero — a coffee shop powered by my own POS. Now I love building from scratch, connecting business and tech together.
